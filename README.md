# factorial
A Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number.

# Visual Factorial Calculator

This is a command-line Python script designed to calculate the factorial of a user-provided number.

Unlike a standard calculator that just gives a final answer, this tool prints each step of the multiplication process to the console. This visual breakdown makes it an excellent educational resource for anyone learning about factorial operations for the first time.

## Features

-   Accepts any positive integer as input.
-   Calculates the correct factorial result.
-   Displays a clear, step-by-step visualization of the entire calculation.
-   Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `factorial.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5.  Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    python factorial.py
    ```
6.  The program will then prompt you to enter a number.

## Usage Example

If you input the number `4`, the script will produce the following output, showing you exactly how it arrives at the answer of 24.

```
Number:4
4!
4 x 3
= 12
12 x 2
= 24
24 x 1
= 24
The factorial is 24
```
